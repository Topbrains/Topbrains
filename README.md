- 👋 Hi, I’m @Topbrains
- I don'd want Chat GPT, Microsoft or anybody else to profit unfarily from my work. If I post to an open code platform I expect the code to be forever free. I don't expect any body to profit from it simply because they built an elegant search engine that reads and re-hashes my code. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Dart, Flutter, C, Javascript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Patterns, Clean Code, and a little Software Architecture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Signals
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Signals
